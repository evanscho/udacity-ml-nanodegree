Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree project files and notes.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for [Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) which I started working on in June 2018.

The Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree is an online certification. It involves

1. Courses in supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning and
2. Six projects (p0-p5 in this directory).

Courses include lecture videos, quizzes and programming problems. These courses were developed by Georgia Tech, Udacity, Google and Kaggle.

This directory includes lecture notes (`lesson_notes`) and project code (`p0` to `p5`).

## Program Outline:

1. Machine Learning Foundations
  * Project 1: Titanic Survival Exploration
2. Model Evaluation and Validation
  * Project 2: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
3. Supervised Learning
  * Project 3: Finding Donors for CharityML
4. Unsupervised Learning
  * Project 4: Creating Customer Segments (Segmenting customers based on spending in different categories)
5. Deep Learning
  * Project 5: Dog Breed Classifier
6. Reinforcement Learning
  * Project 6: Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly
7. Machine Learning Capstone
  * Project 7: Capstone Project
